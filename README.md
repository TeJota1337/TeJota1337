## About me
 My name is Tiago, but please call me "TJ".
 I'm a UX Game Designer and I am currently working for a XR development center in PUCPR.
 We are making a lot of changes in how the education is done and I am really proud of it.

 Here you will see some of my personal projects, nothing really special but everything is made with heart.

 That's it.
