## About me
Greetings, adventurer! My name is Tiago, though you may call me "TJ". I am a proud UX Game Designer, currently embarking on an epic quest at PUCPR, where weâ€™re reshaping the very foundations of how knowledge (and magic, maybe...) is wielded. The progress weâ€™re making fills my heart with prideâ€”this journey is one for the books.

In this place, youâ€™ll find a collection of my personal projects. They may seem humble, but each one is forged with passion and dedication, like a finely crafted sword.

May your path be full of treasures and triumphs!
